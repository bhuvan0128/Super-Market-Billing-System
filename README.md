# Supermarket Billing System 

# Project Overview
The Supermarket Billing System is a Python-based application designed to streamline the billing process in a supermarket. It processes multiple items, calculates total prices, applies discounts based on predefined conditions, and generates an itemized receipt for the customer. This interactive system is built to ensure accurate and efficient billing.


# Key Requirements:

1. The system must allow for multiple items to be processed in a single transaction.

2. Conditional statements should be used to apply discounts based on criteria (e.g., total amount, item type, or promotions).

3. The program should calculate and display the subtotal, any discounts applied, and the final total amount due.

4. The itemized bill should display the name, quantity, price of each item, and the final total after discounts.

5. Loops should be utilized to handle continuous input of items until the billing process is complete.

# Key Concepts Used
- Loops: To handle continuous input until the billing process is complete.
- Conditional Statements: To apply discounts based on specified criteria.
- Interactive Input: To ensure real-time item entry by the cashier.
- Basic Arithmetic Operations: To calculate subtotals, discounts, and final amounts.
